# Provider Ownership Matrix

Scope: `python-services/ai-proveedores`

## Why this exists
This matrix documents the live ownership boundaries for `ai-proveedores`:

- `onboarding`
- `review`
- `maintenance`
- `availability`

It records who owns each state, who reads it, who writes it, and whether it is still a bridge.

## Current Folder Model

The repo already uses the following layout in production:

```text

│   └── maintenance/
├── routes/
│   ├── onboarding/

│   ├── review/
│   └── maintenance/
├── services/
│   ├── availability/  # availability request/response helpers and Redis processor

```

## Ownership Rules

- `owner` is the context that should ultimately decide the state.
- `writer` is the code path that currently emits the state.
- `reader` is the code path that still consumes or normalizes the state.
- `bridge` means the state is still allowed as compatibility glue.

## Practical Reading

If a state is owned by:

- `onboarding`, it should never open the maintenance menu or reclaim a provider that Supabase already considers registered.
- `review`, it should never continue normal business operations.
- `maintenance`, it should never decide onboarding capture rules.
- `availability`, it should only handle provider responses to client-originated availability requests.

If a state still appears as a bridge, it means we still need compatibility for:

- persisted sessions
- legacy router paths
- reentry from older flows

Frontend note:

- `pending_verification` is owned by backend review/onboarding flows, but it is not a public
  frontend status anymore.
- The admin UI should derive "Nuevos" from `onboarding_step`, not from `ProviderStatus`.

## Folder Guidance

The folder guidance is now a live map of the existing structure:

- `flows/onboarding` should own onboarding decisions
- `routes/onboarding` should own onboarding entry, consent, and confirmation
- `routes/review` should own review entry and silence
- `routes/availability` should own the provider-facing availability wait state
- `routes/maintenance` should own post-approval navigation
- `routes/maintenance/deletion` should own record-deletion confirmation
- `routes/maintenance/info` should own personal and professional submenu actions
- `services/onboarding`, `services/review`, `services/maintenance` should hold the business helpers for each context
- `services/availability` should hold the availability request/response helpers and Redis processor
- `services/shared` should only contain true shared primitives

## Next Step

The next cleanup should focus on removing old compatibility notes only after no live reader or writer remains.
